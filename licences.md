This is the Internet. Even if you don't like us (we still like you, really) for some reason, we can't (and wouldn't) stop you and maintain any semblance of a moral high ground, so have fun. Permission granted. This was made to be played, after all.
        
A courtesy notification is definitely appreciated, as well as a link to the wiki. As a consideration to the community, I would request that you make all possible efforts in order to comply with the respective licenses and terms of all other mods in your pack.</td>

Free for non-commercial use.

You are also free to produce Bukkit ports. A link to this thread would be nice for any of the above, but that's all I ask.
        
You also have implied permission to build mods that depend on PowerCrystalsCore, if you want some of the functionality in there.</td>
